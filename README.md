### Game operation
1. An admin confirm prompt will start and ask if you are an admin or not.
2. If admin is a Yes a list of the words that are used in the hangman game will be displayed. 
3. If admin is no, a prompt will display to ask to start the game as a user.
4. User has a yes or no option and will execute the start of the game if yes. No will display a goodbye message.
5. When an answer is wrong a hangman image will begin to display. If you guess wrong 10 times hangman is filled up and you lose.
6. When you lose or answer correctly a prompt will pop up asking if you would like to Start game again.

To display hangman I found a great tutorial on google and the array was premade for me to utilize. I was able to add it to an object and incorporate it into the main.js.
